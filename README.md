# ML Tower Defense

<!-- ![Project Screenshot][project-screenshot] -->

The purpose of this project was to develop a tower defense game using either the Unity or Unreal game engine and include machine learning in some way. Our team decided to create a 2D tower defense game in Unity where there would be special enemies powered by machine learning. 

The game includes the essential elements from the tower defense genre such as towers, enemies, a currency system, and a base that the player has to defend. We also added in additional gameplay features to make the game more unique. To implement the machine learning agent, we made use of Unityâ€™s ML-Agent toolkit which provided us with the tools to create an agent and train in an environment. While working on the machine learning agent, we ran into challenges of getting the enemy to behave correctly in the context of our game. 

In the end, although we were unable to succeed with the complete implementation of a machine learning agent, the result of this project turned out to be a complete tower defense game that is enjoyable, engaging, and different from traditional tower defense games.
